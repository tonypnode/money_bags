# TonyPNode's 'Money Bags' App
Been a while since I've played with django and python.

### For the love... why a bill tracking app?!
Well, My amazing wife uses excel to track family bills and it makes my brain splode. AAANnnndd, since my goal in life is to rid the world
of that evil, I asked her about her process and why excel works for her.

I jotted down the notes and thought I would turn it into an app that she could use.

More to follow, just wanted to get my first commit in so I could go to bed :).
